From the user's perspective, the program prompts the user for a number of football-related statistics from Notre Dame's history, such as displaying the record for a given year or displaying years with more losses than wins. If more information is needed, the user will also be prompted to input any additional information. The program then asks again until "exit" is chosen.

Internally, the choices picker is nearly identical to last week, where there is a while loop which calls an "ask" function until "exit" is chosen. The "ask" function has a switch case block which asks for specific inputs and does different function calls depending on the choice. The first function, which returns the wins an losses for a year, just takes an int as a parameter, offsets it by the start year, then passes it as an index for the wins[] and losses[] arrays to get the right year. The next five functions all work by iterating through the wins[] and losses[] array and "cout"s the year when certain conditions are met, such as "wins[i] > n". The only real difference between these functions is what conditions are to be checked.

I verified the output is correct by checking with the example and passing random inputs and verifying the outputs by reading the raw data.
